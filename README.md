# Linear Regression Machine Learning Project for House Price Prediction

This project uses a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as area income, house age, number of rooms, and population. The dataset contains information about 5000 houses in the USA.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries:

- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

These libraries can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
# Data
The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named `USA_Housing.csv`. It contains the following columns:

- `Avg. Area Income`
- `Avg. Area House Age`
- `Avg. Area Number of Rooms`
- `Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms`
- `Area Population`
- `Price`
- `Address`

# Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `USA_Housing.csv`: The dataset file.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

# Usage
To use this project, simply clone or download the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the `analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. This notebook contains detailed explanations for each step, including:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Load the necessary Python libraries.
2. **Loading and Exploring Data**: Import the dataset and perform initial data analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use visualizations like pair plots, distribution plots, and heatmaps to explore relationships between features.
4. **Training the Model**: Create and train a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
6. **Predictions**: Visualize the predictions and compare them to actual values.

# Results
The linear regression model predicts house prices with reasonable accuracy, as shown by the regression evaluation metrics and visualizations.
